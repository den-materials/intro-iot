# Intro to the Internet of Things

## Objectives
*By the end of this lesson, developers will be able to:*

- **Define** the Internet of Things

## What is the Internet of Things?

Simply put, the **Internet of Things** is the concept of basically connecting any device with an on and off switch to the Internet (and/or to each other). This includes everything from cellphones, coffee makers, washing machines, headphones, and lamps, to wearable devices and almost anything else you can think of.

## What are your major tools?

### Hardware

There are two major types of devices that you will code for in the Internet of Things.  **Microcontrollers** are small computers on a single integrated circuit.  This allows you to send a set of instructions through one or more CPUs (processors) in the same way you run code through your computer's CPU.  A **microcomputer** is a fully functioning, yet small, computer.  It works in basically the same way as your MacBook, just with much less memory, processing speed, and a smaller hard drive.

  - Arduino (contains a **microcontroller**)
  - Raspberry Pi (is a **microcomputer**)
  - Beaglebone Black (is a **microcomputer**)

### Software / Languages

  - C++ 
    - Arduino
  - Objective-C 
    - Apple Wearables
  - bash scripting / terminal
    - Raspberry Pi
    - Beaglebone Black
  - Johnny5
    - JS converter to basically any hardware above
